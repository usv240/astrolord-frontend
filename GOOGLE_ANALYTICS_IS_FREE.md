## 🚫 NOT Costs

These are often confused as GA costs but they're NOT:

| Service | Cost | Is GA? |
|---------|------|--------|
| Google Analytics | FREE ✅ | YES (what you use) |
| Google Ads | Pay-per-click | NO (advertising platform) |
| Google Cloud Services | Variable | NO (hosting, storage) |
| Google Search Console | FREE | NO (SEO tool) |
| Google Tag Manager | FREE | NO (easier analytics setup) |

## 📊 How GA4 Makes Money (Not from You)

Google offers GA4 free because:
1. **Data collection** - They use insights for their own products
2. **Lead generation** - Businesses upgrade to Google Cloud services
3. **Ad ecosystem** - Better targeting for Google Ads customers
4. **User lock-in** - More people dependent on Google ecosystem

**TL;DR: Google gives it away free, you benefit 100%**
